              You draw upon the Force to help you recover from injuries, gain special insight and other remarkable acts. When you rest and meditate to gather the Force, roll +spirit. On a **strong hit**, take up to +3 Force. On a **weak hit**, take +2. On a **miss**, take +2 Force but [Endure Harm](datasworn:move:starforged/suffer/endure_harm) (-2). Your max Force is +5. When you make moves aided by the Force, add +2 and suffer -1 Force.

              When you Strike with the Force guiding your hand, you may roll +Wits or +Spirit instead of +Iron. On a strong hit, mark progress twice, but you must Sacrifice Resources (focus, energy, or risk detection).
