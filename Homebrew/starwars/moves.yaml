      The __adventure moves__ encompass broadly useful actions to overcome obstacles, reinforce your position, conduct investigations, influence others, and support your fellow protagonists. When you face a peril or try to gain leverage, and another move does not apply, you'll likely find your answer among these moves.

          On a __strong hit__, you are successful. Take +1 momentum.

          On a __weak hit__, you succeed, but not without a cost. Make a suffer move (-1).

          On a __miss__, you fail, or a momentary success is undermined by a dire turn of events. [Pay the Price](datasworn:move:fe_runners/fate/pay_the_price).
